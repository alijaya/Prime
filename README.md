#### Prime currently consists of these stable high-quality libraries:

* core:      Core interfaces and generic utilities.
* signals:   Strictly typed, lightweight, memory and cpu optimized signal (event) library.
* bindable:  Data-binding built on signals.
* i18n:      YAML based compile-time internalization library built on Franco's [thx](http://github.com/fponticelli/thx) localization helpers and Bindable.
* mvc:       Strictly typed Model-View-Controller for stateful GUI applications.
* fsm:       Finite State Machine, with state change events built on signals.
* layout:    2D box-model layouting for anything.


#### Stable libraries, optimized for Flash:

* display:    Flash Display-list as a datastructure with signals and change events.
* components: GUI components
* media:      Video and Audio player stream state handling and components.


#### Alpha quality libraries:

* perceptor: See what's happening inside your Prime application. Firebug-like inspector.
* data:      Generic data handling. ValueObjects, CSV parser and other utils.


# Getting started

Each library has it's own README which gives you more detail what they are about.
We've built a [sample TODO-list application](http://github.com/touch/Prime-Todo) to see most of our libraries in action.
