== Box Model

PrimeVC implements a layout-model comparibable to the http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ui/#box-sizing[css3 box-sizing] value `border-box`. The original css-box-model can be quite frustrating when you work with liquid layouts so we tried to fix it by only implementing the `border-box` model.

NOTE: Prime-developers: `border-box` is supported by all modern browsers. PrimeVC should be able to apply some automatic quirkcs for the html-implementation with support for IE6/7.
