# Prime Components

A set of graphical user interface components built on various Prime libs. Standard components including
buttons, input fields, message boxes, combo boxes, lists, sliders, text areas, labels, images, etc..

Components can be logically structured hierarchically by being children of containers or other components,
inheriting position and state, unless otherwise overriden through code or CSS.

Components can be skinned. A skin can be thought of as a decorator object that adds additional behaviour and/or appearance to a component.
